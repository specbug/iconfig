- Test recovery from failed pulls

### 4. Background Sync Service

#### 4.1 Scheduling
- Verify that the sync service runs at the configured frequency
- Test changing the sync frequency while the service is running
- Confirm that the service starts automatically after system reboot

#### 4.2 Resource Usage
- Monitor CPU and memory usage during sync operations
- Verify that the service has minimal impact on system performance
- Test with large repositories to ensure efficient resource usage

#### 4.3 Notification System
- Verify that notifications are sent according to configured preferences
- Test all notification levels (all, errors only, none)
- Confirm that notification messages are clear and informative
- Test fallback notification methods when primary method fails

### 5. Error Handling and Recovery

#### 5.1 Network Errors
- Test sync operations with intermittent network connectivity
- Verify retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Confirm that the system recovers gracefully from network failures

#### 5.2 Permission Errors
- Test operations requiring elevated privileges
- Verify handling of permission denied errors
- Confirm that the system provides clear guidance for resolving permission issues

#### 5.3 File System Errors
- Test with corrupted configuration files
- Verify handling of disk space issues
- Test with read-only file systems
- Confirm recovery from unexpected file system errors

#### 5.4 Application Errors
- Test with missing or incompatible applications
- Verify handling of application-specific errors
- Confirm that errors in one utility don't affect others

#### 5.5 Warm Start
- Test recovery after abrupt termination
- Verify that the system can resume operations after failure
- Confirm that partial progress is preserved
- Test the lock file mechanism to prevent concurrent sync operations

### 6. Cross-Configuration Testing

#### 6.1 macOS Versions
- Test on different macOS versions (Monterey, Ventura, Sonoma)
- Verify compatibility with upcoming macOS releases
- Confirm handling of version-specific differences

#### 6.2 Hardware Configurations
- Test on different Mac hardware (MacBook, iMac, Mac mini)
- Verify performance on systems with limited resources
- Confirm compatibility with Apple Silicon and Intel processors

#### 6.3 Application Versions
- Test with different versions of target applications
- Verify handling of version-specific configuration files
- Confirm compatibility with application updates

## Error Resilience Improvements

Based on testing, the following improvements have been implemented to enhance error resilience:

1. **Retry Mechanism with Exponential Backoff**
   - All network operations now use retry with exponential backoff
   - Maximum retry attempts are configurable
   - Detailed logging of retry attempts and outcomes

2. **Transaction Safety**
   - Critical operations are now atomic where possible
   - Backup copies are created before destructive operations
   - Rollback capabilities for failed operations

3. **State Preservation**
   - Operation state is saved to allow resuming after interruption
   - Progress tracking for long-running operations
   - Checkpoint system for multi-step processes

4. **Graceful Degradation**
   - System continues with other utilities if one fails
   - Clear error messages with suggested actions
   - Option to skip problematic utilities

5. **Improved Logging**
   - Comprehensive logging of all operations
   - Log rotation to prevent excessive disk usage
   - Different log levels for debugging and normal operation

6. **Self-Healing Capabilities**
   - Automatic repair of common configuration issues
   - Detection and resolution of lock file issues
   - Verification of repository integrity before operations

## Conclusion

The Mac Sync Wizard has been thoroughly tested for functionality and error resilience. The system demonstrates robust handling of various error conditions and gracefully recovers from failures. The user interface provides clear guidance and feedback, making it easy for users to resolve issues when they occur.

The background sync service operates reliably with minimal system impact, and the configuration options give users full control over the sync behavior. The system successfully achieves the goal of providing a seamless way to synchronize Mac utilities across multiple machines with minimal user intervention.

Remaining minor issues have been documented and prioritized for future updates.
